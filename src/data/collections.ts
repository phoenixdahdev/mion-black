        narrative: `
      The Fall/Winter 2025 collection, "The Void Walking," explores the space between presence and absence. 
      Inspired by brutalist architecture and the concept of negative space, we stripped away the superfluous to reveal the essential structure of the garment—and the wearer.
      
      Fabrics are dense, absorbing light rather than reflecting it. Wool felts, structured cottons, and oxidized metals form a protective shell against the noise of the modern world.
      This is not clothing for the faint of heart. It is an armor for the soul.
