        narrative: `
      Rooted in discipline, pressure, and self-belief, each piece is designed as a response to resistance. 
      The weight of the fabric mirrors the weight of ambition. Nothing is accidental. Nothing is decorative without purpose.
      Inspired by urban tension, raw structure, and the silence that exists inside chaos, MIONBLACK strips fashion down to its core.
