        narrative: `
      Rooted in discipline, pressure, and self-belief, each piece is designed as a response to resistance. 
      The weight of the fabric mirrors the weight of ambition. Nothing is accidental. Nothing is decorative without purpose.
      Inspired by urban tension, raw structure, and the silence that exists inside chaos, MIONBLACK strips fashion down to its core.

      The Hybrid Jersey collection represents the fusion of athletic performance materials with avant-garde tailoring. 
      Structured drapes, reinforced seams, and ballistic nylon inserts create a silhouette that is both fluid and armored.
